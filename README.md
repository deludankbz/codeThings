<h2 align="center"> Find your all of your TODO's. </h2>

## Usage/Examples

```bash
$ python3 main.py

@ src/ex.py :: found 4 tasks!

	# TODO: fhosiofs
	# FIX
	# NOTE
	# ERROR:

@ src/utils/fileIO.py :: found 2 tasks!

	# FIX: gitignore might not be present in path; will cause erros
	# TODO: make this bit into a config file

@ README.md :: found 1 tasks!

	# mogg - Find your all of your TODO's
```

## Goals
- Better ignore and extensions
- Better comment handling since quite a few languages have multiline comments
- Options to: 
    - Print all comments
    - Print comments only for a selected language
